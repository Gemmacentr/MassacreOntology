            <p>  The main objective of this project was to create an ontology that would describe the massacre in Bologna on 2 August 1980 and, secondly, to bring to light inconsistencies, problems and deficiencies that led to a lack of complete understanding of what happened. 2020 was the 40th anniversary of this massacre and the historian Vanessa Roghi wrote an article in the Italian weekly magazine <a href="https://www.internazionale.it/opinione/vanessa-roghi/2020/08/02/strage-di-bologna">'The International'</a> telling her testimony, having found itself near the waiting room of the central station of Bologna shortly before the explosion of the bomb. A very interesting piece of the article was</p>
             <p><em>‘On Bologna historians have not done any of this, because, as for the massacres, they stopped at 1974, the year in which, by historiographical convention, ends the strategy of tension (An exception is represented by the essay by Miguel Gotor L'Italia del novecento). Bologna lacks a key to reading. That of August 2 appears so a massacre hanging in the void.'</em> </p>
          <p>The first information to which ontology proposes to respond is entirely informative, such as the <b>Place</b> of the event, the <b>Time</b> and <b>by who</b> organized the massacre.</p>
          <p>But going specifically and starting from the testimony of <a href="https://www.internazionale.it/tag/autori/vanessa-roghi">Vanessa Roghi</a>, was identified the first problem: <b>the lack of quantitative descriptive sources</b>, and not, concerning the massacre, for which was created the class <b>'Media'</b>, its subclasses: Radio','Newcast','Book', 'Television' and the data properties to the subclass <b>'Source'</b> related: <em>'Numberofpublishedessays'</em> and <em>'Numberofpublishedbooks'</em>.</p> 
          <p> It is interesting to note that the massacre took place at 10:15 and the first edition of the news that informed all of Italy was aired two hours later.</p>
        <p>In addition, attention was also given to <b>Witnesses</b>, present physically and not, who helped in the investigation. In the population of ontology the Witness is Massimo Sparti who reported that he had received a visit from the couple Mambro-Fioravanti, who was given the paternity of the incident, two days after the massacre during which Fioravanti would also make a joke on the bomb.</p>
        <p>The class of <b>Person</b> was then populated with the most famous names concerning this massacre: Luigi Fioravanti, Luigi Ciavardini, Francesca Mambro while the class of <b>Organization</b> with ' ‘ArmedRevolutionaryNuclei’, an Italian terrorist organization of neo-fascist inspiration which included Mambro and Fioravanti and ¡ Terzaposition' of which Ciavardini was part.</p>
        <p>Another very interesting aspect was the misdirection from which the class was born, which was a phone call made to Radio Popolare a few hours after the massacre in which the Red Brigades were accused.</p> 
        <p>That same afternoon, Radio Popolare received a denial from the Red Brigades themselves that it was believed to be reliable.</p>
        <p>To conclude, the class <b>‘Reason'</b> highlights the possible reasons that pushed the massacre, in this case all the various hypotheses lead to a reason <b>‘Political'</b>.</p>
